text1: I'm a full-stack developer with years of experience in both software architecture and product management. I have a strong background in working with nonprofits, startups, and international teams. I also have substantial working experience in advertising and digital marketing.
text2: I was born in Lima but grew up in the States and lived there for twenty years before moving back in the beginning of 2020. I'm fond of cats and love video games. I'm a firm believer that we should always give back to our communities, and I currently code pro bono for a Peruvian nonprofit. There's something humbling and powerful in recognizing that our problems are miniscule when we serve others.
text3: I'm currently employed at an international software development agency. I love my work and find it personally rewarding.
