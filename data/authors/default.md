text1: I'm a full-stack developer with years of experience in both software engineering and project management. I have a strong background in working with nonprofits, small companies, and international teams. I hold a bachelor's in Advertising and Digital Marketing.
text2: I was born in Lima but grew up in the States and lived there for twenty years before moving back in the beginning of 2020. I love to write and I've written a novel, a memoir, three short story collections, and a book of poetry. I'm fond of cats and love video games. I'm a firm believer in that we should always be learning. Right now, I'm learning how to paint.
text3: I'm currently employed as a mid-senior React Engineer at an international software development agency. I love what I do but I'm open to new opportunities.
