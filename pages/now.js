            We provide software development and consultancy services. Each project normally lasts
            about six months from conception to completion.

            The company is based in the US but has offices in other countries. We have a
            multicultural and international workforce, and it's also pretty laid back. I love it
            here.

            I don't code too much as part of this role, but when I do, I mostly work the MERN stack.

            My main duties are designing business-oriented product solutions, helping clients
            transition over to us as a solutions architect, and implementing operations processes in
            our offices. I also coded the company website myself (prior to it being updated). I used
            React and Tailwind and, before I handed it over for maintenance to the dev team, I was
            working on using Astro.js for the CMS.

            I live in Lima semi-permanently but travel around South America for most of the year. I
            suppose I'm biased but Peruvian cuisine is my favorite Latin American cuisine. I'm a few
            blocks away from the Pacific Ocean so I've been thinking about taking up surfing.
